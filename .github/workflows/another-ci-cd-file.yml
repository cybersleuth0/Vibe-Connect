# .github/workflows/flutter-ci.yml
# Your First Flutter CI/CD Pipeline - Keep It Simple!

# Give your pipeline a name (shows up in GitHub UI)
name: Flutter CI

# WHEN should this run?
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]  # Every time you push to main branch
  pull_request:         # Every time someone creates a PR

# Define what to do
jobs:
  # Job 1: Check if code is good
  analyze-and-test:
    name: 🔍 Analyze & Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Use free Ubuntu computer from GitHub
    timeout-minutes: 15     # Cancel if stuck for >15 minutes

    steps:
      # Step 1: Download your code to the runner
      - name: 📥 Get code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Install Flutter on the runner
      - name: 🐦 Setup Flutter
        uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          flutter-version: '3.38.0'  # Change to your Flutter version
          channel: 'stable'
          cache: true  # Speeds up future runs

      # Step 3: Download all packages from pubspec.yaml
      - name: 📦 Get dependencies
        run: flutter pub get

      # Step 4: Check code formatting
      - name: ✨ Check formatting
        run: dart format --set-exit-if-changed .
        continue-on-error: true  # Don't fail pipeline if formatting is off

      # Step 5: Look for code errors
      - name: 🔍 Analyze code
        run: flutter analyze

#      # Step 6: Run all tests
#      - name: 🧪 Run tests
#        run: flutter test --reporter github

  # Job 2: Build the app (only runs if Job 1 passes)
  build-apk:
    name: 🏗️ Build APK
    needs: analyze-and-test  # Wait for tests to pass
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 20

    steps:
      # Get code again (each job starts fresh)
      - name: 📥 Get code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Install Java (needed for Android builds)
      - name: ☕ Setup Java
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          distribution: 'zulu'
          java-version: '25'

      # Install Flutter
      - name: 🐦 Setup Flutter
        uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          flutter-version: '3.38.0'

          cache: true

      # Get packages
      - name: 📦 Get dependencies
        run: flutter pub get

      # Build the APK
      - name: 🏗️ Build APK
        run: flutter build apk --release

      # Save the APK so you can download it
      - name: 📤 Upload APK
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4

        # ============================================
        # WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU PUSH CODE:
        # ============================================
        #
        # 1. GitHub sees you pushed code
        # 2. GitHub starts an Ubuntu computer (runner)
        # 3. Runner downloads your code
        # 4. Runner installs Flutter
        # 5. Runner runs: pub get → analyze → test
        # 6. If tests pass, runner builds APK
        # 7. You can download APK from GitHub UI
        #

        # Common issues:
        # - Tests failed: Fix your tests locally first
        # - Analyze failed: Run 'flutter analyze' locally
        # - Format failed: Run 'dart format .' locally
        # - Build failed: Run 'flutter build apk' locally
